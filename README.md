Yes its stupid project but it was fun creating it so let me explain how it works


if you take a look at the annimation each word is spinning in a circle, but the circle is turned so the letter goes away from you and comes back. Now you can represent circles with trigonometry (all the time i was worried when i am going to use cos and sin lol). So for each letter we creating animation where it starts from 0 degrees and goes to 360. Then translate y based on the sin of the angle multiply it by factor of 100px. Then for scale we need to shrink to 0 and back.
